Launchfile description:
 - gmapping_scout.launch: performs GMapping with /scout_odom
 - gmapping_camera.launch: performs GMapping with /camera/odom/sample
 - amcl.launch: performs localization with AMCL using the recorded map
 - ekf.launch: perform localization with EKF using the recorded map


Bags used:
 - Only the "default" bags were used
 - Map was creating by using 1.bag
 - AMCL was performed by using 2.bag
 - EKF was performed by using 3.bag


TF Tree:
 - The structure of the TF Tree was not changed, only the missing static transform was added
 - "rosrun rqt_tf_tree rqt_tf_tree" can be used to visualize the tree


Node description:
 - conversion.cpp: used to quickly convert yaw in the corresponding quaternion


GMapping infos:
 - I decided to use the odometry provided from Intel camera in place of scout/odom
 - This because scout_odom already proved to be very imprecise in the first project


Robot localization infos:
 - Sensors used:
    - Odometry from the Intel Camera: good source of odometry
    - GT Pose from the OptiTrack: provides accurate position, even if not always present
    - IMU from the Pixhawk Mini: the only source of absolute orientation
    => to this task, IMU tools were used to fuse the IMU data and retrieve the orientation
 - The true/false of the config matrix were established by looking at the filed of the messages with "rostopic echo"
